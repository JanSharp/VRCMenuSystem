- [x] Show an effective lockstep loading screen, during which none of the pages are accessible, because we do not know the local player's permissions and many pages won't even work without lockstep being initialized
  - [x] Reuse it for imports
- [x] When missing permissions to see any page at all, show some info text in the UI
- [ ] Option to collapse the side panel by default, part of the menu configuration
- [ ] Popups
  - [ ] hide popups when showing loading page, do not close them... probably? Systems probably should have custom special handling for when a popup is open while an import gets started
  - [x] API to close a popup, no matter where it is in the stack (for example when losing permission to do what the popup is related to)
- [ ] Open close key binds
  - [ ] Hold tab on desktop, using screen space UI
    - [ ] Surround the player's in a cube of invisible canvases to make interaction with the screen space UI possible (yes this is a hack I found by accident)
  - [ ] In VR, right joystick (vertical look), matching what Sylan did simply for muscle memory as it is good enough... and like what else are we supposed to use
    - [ ] Down Up
    - [ ] Down Down
    - [ ] Hold Down
- [ ] Different types of positioning of the UI
  - [ ] In front - Appears in front of your face, moves with your avatar, does not rotate
    - [ ] Maybe adjustable positioning? Like distance from you head? I don't think so though, it should be positioned such that it is nicely readable and comfortably interactable, which I don't believe varies much. Or so I would hope
  - [ ] Left hand
  - [ ] Right hand
    - [ ] For hand attachment... adjustable relative positioning?
- [ ] Maybe UI sidebar position switching between the left and right side
- [ ] A close button...
  - Maybe by putting it at the top of the side bar?
  - Maybe at the bottom?
  - Maybe effectively floating outside of the main UI?
- [ ] look at rect 2d mask for scroll view masking
- [ ] the loading bar when disappearing seems to stick around for longer than it should, as it is still visible while the page is also already visible
